## ⚙️ Enable GitHub Pages

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Go to your repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/agent5479/LarsBees
   ```

2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (⚙️ icon at top)

3. **Click "Pages"** in the left sidebar

4. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - **Source:** Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch:** Select "main"
   - **Folder:** Select "/docs" ← IMPORTANT!
   - Click **"Save"**

## 📁 What Gets Deployed

The `/docs` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Static landing page
- All CSS/JS from CDNs (Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons)
- No server-side code

The main Flask application files (app.py, models.py, etc.) are NOT deployed to GitHub Pages because they require a Python server.

---

## 🔄 Updating Your Site

To update the landing page:

```bash
# 1. Make changes to docs/index.html

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update landing page"
git push

# 3. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to rebuild
```

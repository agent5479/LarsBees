âœ… BEE marshall Team Collaboration & Permissions System - COMPLETE

================================================================================
PHASE 1: Weather Widget Implementation
================================================================================
âœ… Created docs/js/weather.js with OpenWeatherMap integration
âœ… Added weather widget to dashboard grid layout
âœ… Integrated weather.js script in beemarshall-full.html
âœ… Added comprehensive weather widget CSS styling
âœ… Weather widget calls updateWeatherWidget() from dashboard
âœ… Fetches weather based on average cluster GPS coordinates
âœ… Displays today and tomorrow forecast with icons, temp, humidity, wind
âœ… Includes 5-minute caching to reduce API calls
âœ… Includes API key placeholder for user configuration

================================================================================
PHASE 2: Team Collaboration Permissions Module
================================================================================
âœ… Created docs/js/permissions.js with comprehensive RBAC system
âœ… Defined 4 user roles: master_admin, admin, demo_admin, employee
âœ… Created permission constant PERMISSIONS with granular access control
âœ… Employees can create/complete actions, transfer flagged items, update schematics
âœ… Employees cannot delete clusters or actions (restricted to admins)
âœ… Created helper functions: canDeleteCluster, canDeleteAction, canManageEmployees, etc.
âœ… All functions exposed globally for use across the application
âœ… Added showPermissionDeniedAlert() for consistent user feedback
âœ… Added user role display name and badge color functions

================================================================================
PHASE 3: Permissions Integration Across Application
================================================================================
âœ… Updated docs/js/clusters.js:
   - Replaced isAdmin check with canDeleteCluster() permission check
   - Updated deleteCluster() function to use showPermissionDeniedAlert()
âœ… Updated docs/js/actions.js:
   - Replaced isAdmin check with canDeleteAction() permission check
   - Updated deleteAction() function to use showPermissionDeniedAlert()
âœ… Updated docs/js/employees.js:
   - Replaced isAdmin check with canManageEmployees() permission check
   - Updated showEmployees(), handleAddEmployee(), and removeEmployee()
âœ… Updated docs/js/scheduling.js:
   - Added hasPermission('TASK_COMPLETE') check to completeScheduledTask()
âœ… Added js/permissions.js script to beemarshall-full.html before other modules
âœ… All permission checks now use centralized permission functions
âœ… Consistent error messaging with showPermissionDeniedAlert()

================================================================================

1. Test with employee user account to verify restrictions work correctly
2. Add visual role indicators (badges) in user profile/header area
3. Consider adding permission checks for data export functions
4. Add audit logging for permission-denied actions
5. Configure OpenWeatherMap API key in docs/js/weather.js

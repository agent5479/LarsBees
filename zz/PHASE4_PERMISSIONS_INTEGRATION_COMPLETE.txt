âœ… Phase 4 Complete: Permissions Integration Across Application

Phase 4 Summary - Permissions Integration:
- Updated docs/js/clusters.js: Replaced isAdmin check with canDeleteCluster() permission check
- Updated docs/js/actions.js: Replaced isAdmin check with canDeleteAction() permission check
- Updated docs/js/employees.js: Replaced isAdmin check with canManageEmployees() permission check
- Updated docs/js/scheduling.js: Added hasPermission('TASK_COMPLETE') check to completeScheduledTask()
- Added js/permissions.js script to beemarshall-full.html before other modules
- All permission checks now use centralized showPermissionDeniedAlert() function
- Employee role can now create/complete actions, transfer to schedule, update schematics
- Employee role cannot delete clusters, actions, or manage other employees

Permission System Now Fully Integrated:
âœ… Cluster deletion protected by canDeleteCluster()
âœ… Action deletion protected by canDeleteAction()
âœ… Employee management protected by canManageEmployees()
âœ… Task completion requires TASK_COMPLETE permission (all roles)
âœ… Consistent user feedback with showPermissionDeniedAlert()

Next Steps for Production:
- Test with employee user account to verify restrictions
- Add visual indicators (badges) showing user role in UI
- Consider adding permission checks for export functions
- Add audit logging for permission-denied actions
